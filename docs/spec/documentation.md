k8tre_statements:
  spec: All TRE components, or entire TREs developed by TRE developers, must have discoverable and clear documentation pertaining to all the component or TRE's features. This includes guidance for end users and TRE operators.
  satre:
    - ref: 2.1.5
      rationale: SATRE requires TRE operators to provide clear guidance on how to use software tools and work with data in the TRE. Any K8TRE-compliant component or entire TRE must therefore provide such user-facing guidance where necessary.
    - ref: 4.3.1
      rationale: SATRE requires TRE operators to document all features of their TRE implementation. Developers of K8TRE components or entire TREs must therefore provide clear and discoverable documentation of all features of their components or TREs to enable TRE operators to meet this SATRE requirement.
